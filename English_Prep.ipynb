        "3.  **Setting**: The time and place where the story occurs. Good setting descriptions help create the mood or atmosphere.\n",

While his colleagues saw it as irrelevant, Sharma felt a chill. He knew the victim's last name was Poe. This wasn't just a clue; it was a message. The killer wasn't just a thief; they were a poet, and this was the first line of their dark verse.

The primary objective was to determine whether the transition to a virtual format improved or hindered the speed of case disposals. **(Methodology)** A quantitative analysis of case disposal rates was conducted using court data from 2018 to 2022. This was supplemented by qualitative data from structured interviews with 50 advocates to understand their procedural experiences. **(Results)** The findings indicate that while e-hearings initially caused a 30% decline in efficiency due to technical challenges, they led to a 15% increase in the disposal of interlocutory applications by 2022. However, the disposal rate for evidence-based trial matters remained significantly lower compared to pre-pandemic physical hearings. **(Conclusion)** The study concludes that e-hearings are effective for procedural matters but are less efficient for substantive trials.

        "> The Basic Structure Doctrine is a legal principle evolved by the Supreme Court of India in the landmark case of *Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala* (1973). This doctrine posits that while the Parliament of India has the power to amend the Constitution under Article 368, this power is not absolute. The Parliament cannot amend, abrogate, or destroy the \"basic structure\" or fundamental framework of the Constitution. The Supreme Court, however, has not provided an exhaustive list of what constitutes the basic structure. Over time, through various judgments, elements like the supremacy of the Constitution, the rule of law, judicial review, secularism, federalism, and the separation of powers between the legislature, executive, and judiciary have been recognized as part of it.
